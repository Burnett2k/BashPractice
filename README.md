# BashPractice

Anything you can run on the command line, you can run in a script and it will do exactly the same thing.

If you can already do some commands on the command line, then you probably know more about scripting than you realize.

Scripts are entered into a plain text file and then invoked.

## Execution:
Before running a bash script, it must have the execution permission set. If you forget to add the permission, you will get an error.

## To add execute permissions:
```
chmod 755 hello-world.sh
```

## To check permission on a script:

## To run hello-world.sh

```
./hello-world.sh
```
